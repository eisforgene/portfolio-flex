## Description:
The assignment was to create a deployed portfolio page in order to showcase my skills and talents to prospective employers. This page required the utilization of recently learned skills such as: flexbox, media queries, and CSS variables. The motivation behind this project was the deploy my personal website to track my progress along the way. Hopefully, leading to a presentable and competitive resume. 

There were numerous problems encountered throughout this assignment such as allocating the write CSS to particular containers, understanding and creating parent-child containers and advanced stylings for the page.
